# Matthew's Numbers
https://xona.com/matthewsnumbers/

These are a set of large numbers I conceived and named after myself as a child. Do not pay too much attention to the nomenclature. I was only young.

# Definitions:

- **Matthew's Number** -- singular -- is a large number, 38,532 digits long, that describes the amount of possible screens in a 160x200 by 16 color graphics mode. It is a TGA (Tandy Graphics Adapter) graphics mode familiar to me at the time I coined this number set. It was used in the original Sierra "Quest" games I played. This number is specifically coined as "Matthew's Number 160x200x16", following a format I decided today for publish.
- **Matthew's Numbers** -- plural -- are all numbers that describe the amount of possible screens in all popular computer graphics modes. These are an extension of the original Matthew's Number.

The relevancy is the appreciation these are finite numbers. No matter what computer graphics mode your devices are using, there are only a finite number of possible screens they can display. These numbers highlight how large "large numbers" can be and how finite numbers can be so large as to effectively be infinite in practical use.
